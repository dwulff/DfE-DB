## Abstract
This research examines decisions from experience in restless bandit problems. Two experiments revealed four main effects. (1) Risk neutrality: the typical participant did not learn to become risk averse, a contradiction of the hot stove effect. (2) Sensitivity to the transition probabilities that govern the Markov process. (3) Positive recency: the probability of a risky choice being repeated was higher after a win than after a loss. (4) Inertia: the probability of a risky choice being repeated following a loss was higher than the probability of a risky choice after a safe choice. These results can be described with a simple contingent sampler model, which assumes that choices are made based on small samples of experiences contingent on the current state.

## Issues
- BEE2009_1
  - unexpected data
    - every subject did both questions, but only the first one was used, that is, subject 1-10, 38-54 used problem 1, other subjects used problem 2


- BEE2009_2
  - unexpected value
    - SeqMar_14, SeqMar_17 has data for all 20 problems. Excluded in processed data.
