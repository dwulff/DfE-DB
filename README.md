### Yang, Y., Spektor, M. S., Thoma, A., Hertwig, R., & Wulff, D. U. (2025). *DfE-DB: A systematic database of 3.8 million human decisions across multiple experience-based tasks*

Learning from experience is central to human decision making, yet research on experience-based choice remains fragmented across paradigms and disciplines. We present the Decision-from-Experience Database (DfE--DB), a standardized, openly accessible resource comprising 3.8 million trial-level decisions from 11,921 participants across 168 studies and 13 paradigms. By harmonizing raw behavioral data and classifying studies along 13 key design features, the database enables quantitative comparisons previously obscured by heterogeneous task and data structures. Using this resource, we show that choice tendencies---toward higher risk, expected value, or experienced mean---vary substantially across paradigms and are strongly shaped by core design features such as feedback type, outcome structure, stationarity, and sampling. These features explain substantial cross-study variability and reveal underexplored paradigm variants. DfE--DB provides the empirical infrastructure necessary to test the generality of behavioral phenomena and computational models, fostering a more integrated science of decisions from experience. <br>

## Organization
This section introduces the database's structure. If you have any questions, contact [Yujia Yang](mailto:shuiyun97@gmail.com) or [Dirk U. Wulff](mailto:wulff@mpib-berlin.mpg.de).

### Database
There are two folders in the root directory: [data](https://github.com/dwulff/DfE-DB/tree/main/data) and [validation](https://github.com/dwulff/DfE-DB/tree/main/validation).</br>
</br>
The "data" folder contains the data organized in 114 sub-folders, one for each paper, and a README file with meta information about the studies included in each paper. The 114 sub-folders are named after the authors' initials and the year of publication. Each paper folder contains the subfolders *raw* and *processed*, the R script used to process the data, and a README file with information about the papers and challenges discovered during data processing. The raw folder contains the raw data as provided by the authors if permission to share the raw data was granted. The *processed* folder contains the data processed to align with the common data format. See details below.</br>
</br>
The "validation" folder contains the results of our data validation presented in a README file and a CSV file, as well as the validation scripts written in Python that were used to produce these results. </br>

### Processed Data
The "processed" folder contains the standard-form data we produced from the raw data. In this folder, every study has one data table and one option table. They are named by "abbreviation of paper_study_data/option.csv". </br>
</br>
In the data table, we provide the short name of the paper, study number, subject ID, problem ID, condition number, options (problem), trial number, participant's choice, feedback participants get, and some other information. You can find the explanation of all variables in the codebook below.  </br> 
</br>
In the option table, we provide the option name and the outcome distribution of the option. For studies with stationary, discrete outcome distribution, we use multiple columns to record possible outcomes and their corresponding probabilities. For example, 'out_1' refers to the first outcome of this option. 'pr_1' refers to the probability of the first outcome. The sum of all 'pr_x' is 1. For other studies, we use the column "description" to describe the outcome distribution of this option.

#### Codebook
1. **paper**: abbreviation of paper using the initials of the first four authors and the year of publication. For example, Yechiam & Busemeyer (2005) is translated to YB2005. In case of non-unique paper identifiers (e.g., two different YB2005 papers), a letter suffix is added (e.g., YB2005a and YB2005b).
2. **study**: index uniquely identifying the study(ies) within the paper, beginning with 1. If multiple studies within a paper share the same study number (e.g., Experiment 1a and Experiment 1b), they are treated as different study, the study number would accumulate.
3. **subject**: a unique participant identifier. If available, we used the same identifier as in the raw data.
4. **problem**: problem identifier specifying the *order* in which the problems occurred. We define "problem" as follows: Within a problem, the association between an option and its location or placeholder (i.e., visual stimulus) remains fixed for the participant. In other words, option A will, within one problem, always be located on the left or represented by, for example, a yellow door (e.g., Ludvig et al., 2014). Note that between participants, the locations or placeholders of an option may change, but the outcome distribution underlying the option will be identical. 
5. **options**: unique identifier (within a problem/study) that specifies the involved choice options in each trial using letters of the alphabet and combined with "_". For example, A_B or A_B_C_D, if the options A and B or the options A, B, C, and D, respectively, were available for choice in the trial. Note that every letter corresponds to a unique option that is coded in the options table for each study. Often, the set of available options in a trial varies within the study. If there are more options than letters in the alphabet, we combined two upper-case letters (i.e., options continue with AA, AB, …, BA, etc.). We used unique option identifiers for problems within the same study (e.g., if a study has two problems, 1 and 2, and each problem has two options, A and B, then the options are coded as problem 1 options A and B, and problem 2 options C and D).
6. **trial**: identifier specifying the individual decisions within a problem. Numbered from first to last decision. 
7. **choice**: identifier specifying the chosen option. For example, one of A, B, C, or D, if the options variable has value A_B_C_D. If the study permits not-choosing an option (e.g., only observing the outcomes or missing a response deadline), the choice is coded as an empty string ("").
8. **outcome**: identifier specifying the outcome of the options (chosen and non-chosen), if available (i.e., the outcomes that a participant observed). Can be either "1" or "0" to represent "success" and "failure", respectively, or the precise outcome observed (e.g., "32 Euros" or "juice"). In the latter case, any unit specifications are omitted. Example: if options variable has value A_B_C_D and the individual outcomes are 4, 32, 5, and 0, respectively, then the outcomes are coded as A:4_B:32_C:5_D:0. Only options that provided outcomes (feedback) were coded. In other words, in the partial-feedback paradigm, only the outcome of the chosen option is coded (e.g., D:0). If in the case of no outcomes (no feedback), outcome is coded the same as choice. If the study permits not-choosing an option (e.g., only observe the outcomes), the outcome is coded as the outcome value (e.g., 0). Finally, if there is no outcome in this stage, it is coded as an empty string ("").
9. **decision**: Only relevant for the sampling paradigm. Identifier specifying the final decision of the sampling process. For example, one of A, B, C, or D, if the options variable has value A_B_C_D.
10. **response_time**: in ms, if provided, otherwise NA.
11. **stage**: for multi-stage decisions, otherwise NA.
12.	**sex**: m or f or ns (not specified), otherwise NA.
13. **age**: in years or ns (not specified), otherwise NA.
14. **education**: as provided, otherwise NA.
15. **note**: an additional explanatory note when necessary. For example, if a study/problem is a repeated choice experiment but the options were fully described, then this variable would contain “description-based”. Another example is when the same problem is repeated with only a slight modification such as repeated sampling or partial vs. full feedback, then this variable would contain this information. Yet another example is when more than one group of participants perform the same problem, such as healthy, low-depression, and high-depression groups, the note variable would contain this information (e.g., “Healthy”, or “High-depression symptoms”). Subject identifiers of participants in each group would be unique in any case (e.g., 1-13 healthy, and 14-20 depressed, etc).

## Validation
We validate our processed data in three ways: Whether the outcome distributions are consistent with those reported in the paper, whether participants choose the option with a higher expected value more often than chance level, whether participants choose the option with a higher observed mean more often than chance level. With these validations, we checked for coding mistakes in the data. More details are provided in the README file in validation folder.
